3. Data Wrangling and Transormation. Majority of the transformation load was done through `pandas-flavor`:

```
self.transformed_df = self.input_frame \
    .tr_pipe.convert_id_type() \
    .tr_pipe.cl_product_brand() \
    .tr_pipe.cl_product_price() \
    .tr_pipe.cl_product_rating() \
    .tr_pipe.create_pack_size_desc() \
    .tr_pipe.create_median_price() \
    .tr_pipe.create_pages() \
    .tr_pipe.create_cat_names() \
    .tr_pipe.create_pack_names()\
    .tr_pipe.fix_fill_names()
```

Using dot notation makes the transformation pipeline easier to document and readable.

4. Loading the clean dataset into tableau dashboard. [Pepsi Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jae.cabrera/viz/PepsiDashboard/MarketSales?publish=yes)
5. And lastly created a machine learning model to predict prices.
